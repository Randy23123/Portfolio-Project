            <p>Hi, my name is Randy Y. Lopez. I graduated from Independence High School in 2021,
             which is also where I got into a python class and loved coding,
             even though my teacher wasn't making it super interesting.
             I still loved it when I was learning it. I may not be the best and I procrastinate a lot.
             It doesn't mean I won't apply myself. I am currently in a Bootcamp by UNCC for web development;
             we all need to start somewhere, but I am still deciding if I want to go into web development or go into cyber security.
             I love it too, or at least the idea cause I did a pre-class from red ventures,
             unfortunately too few openings and 3X the applicants, but in the meantime, ill apply myself to this class.</p>
